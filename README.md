* [ ] instead of checking input with a delay, record input as quickly as possible
    but simply respond to (act upon) the recorded input with a delay.
    that way button pressed won't be missed.
* [ ] rules for keeping score.
* [ ] rule for removing rows when cmopleted.
* [ ] rotation of peice.
* [ ] deal with peices of different sizes.
* [ ] collission detection bugs.
